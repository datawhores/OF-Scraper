    # --- COMMAND OPTIONS ---
    # Choose one of the following 'command' configurations based on your use case.
    # Uncomment the desired option and ensure others are commented out.

    # Option 1: For interactive use (recommended if you frequently run commands manually)
    # This keeps the container running indefinitely in the background.
    command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "sleep infinity"]
    # To bring the container up: `docker compose up -d`
    # Then, to run commands inside it: `docker compose exec -it ofscraper ofscraper {args}`
    # Example: `docker compose exec -it ofscraper ofscraper --username myuser`

    # Option 2: To run the scraper automatically with specific arguments when the container starts
    # Uncomment the line below and comment out Option 1 above.
    # command: "ofscraper --username ALL --posts all"

    # Optional: Configure restart policy.
    # restart: "unless-stopped" # Ensures the container restarts automatically unless explicitly stopped.
