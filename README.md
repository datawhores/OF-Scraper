## Description

command-line tool that lets you download media from OnlyFans and perform bulk actions including liking or unliking posts.

![CopyQ nsUBdI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67020411/227816586-fb685959-cd3f-45af-adea-14773b7154f9.png)

At its inception, this project emerged as a fork of the original onlyfans-scraper. With invaluable support from the community and consistent script updates, we've undergone substantial architectural changes, resulting in a significantly revamped codebase compared to the original master. While some of these modifications are detailed [HERE](https://github.com/datawhores/OF-Scraper/blob/main/CHANGES.md), most are only documented in the commit history.

This script has been thoughtfully crafted to facilitate seamless transitions from DIGITALCRIMINALS' script, ensuring robust compatibility and smooth feature migration. Furthermore, it boasts an extensive array of filtering features, empowering users with precise control over the specific content types they aim to scrape

## Migrating from DC script

To maintain compatibility with your current folders, make sure to modify the metadata option within the config file. Additionally, configure the save_path, dir_path, and filename settings to generate outputs that align with your existing setup.

The inherited metadata files from DIGITALCRIMINALS' script play a crucial role in preventing redundant downloads by acting as a check for duplicates.

For comprehensive guidance on making these adjustments, you can refer to the provided resources

1. [Migration Guide](https://of-scraper.gitbook.io/of-scraper/migrating-from-digitalcriminals-script)
2. [Config Options](https://of-scraper.gitbook.io/of-scraper/config-options)
3. [Customize Save Path](https://of-scraper.gitbook.io/of-scraper/config-options/customizing-save-path)

Ask in the discord or open an issue if you need help with what to change to accomplish this
