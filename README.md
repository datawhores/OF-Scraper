A fork of onlyfans-scraper. It has been optimized to make it more feature complete with digitalcriminal's onlyfans script.
A matter of fact with the right settings transitioning between the two scripts should be a easy enough process

In addition there are numerous filtering features to control exactly which type of content you want to scrape.

## Other menu options    
  
 See: https://github.com/datawhores/OF-Scraper/wiki/Menu-Options 
 
 # commandline
 While the menu is easy to use, and convient. You may want more automation.
 
 The best way to do this is through the commandline system. This will allow you to skip the menu, and for example scrape a provided list of accounts

## Common
### Status Down
      
This typically means that your auth information is not correct, or onlyfans signed you out.
### 404 Issue 
    
This could mean that the content you are trying to scrape is no longer present. It can also indicate that model has deleted her account, and it is no longer accesible on the platform
    
 ### Request taking a long time
   If a request fails ofscraper will pause and try again a few times. This can lead to certain runs taking longer and points.

 ## Known Limitations
 - 1000 likes is the max per day
    
    

# Migrating from DC script

You will need to change the settings so that the metadata option is compatible with your current folders
Additionally you might want to set the save_path, dir_path, and filename so they output similar outputs

The metadata path from digitalcriminal's script is used for duplicate check so as long as your set the right path.
Files won't download a second time
